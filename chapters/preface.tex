\section*{Preface}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------

The present notes correspond to the course ``The Conquest of 
Space: space exploration and rocket science,'' imparted on UC3Mx by
Manuel Sanjurjo,
Mario Merino, 
Manuel Soler,
Gonzalo Sánchez,
David Morante,
Filippo Cichocki,
Daniel Pérez,
Xin Chen, and
Eduardo Ahedo 
from the UC3M Aerospace Engineering department.

The notes are provided as a companion material to the course, and are not
intended as a substitute of a real book or the lessons in the course. They are
conceived as a quick summary without extensive explanations, for which
learners must search elsewhere.  A working  knowledge
of fundamental mathematics (calculus and linear algebra) and physics
(mechanics) is necessary to fully understand everything; 
if you feel a bit uncomfortable with these topics at the start the course, 
please search online or in your library for an introduction to them (or 
ask in the forums).
